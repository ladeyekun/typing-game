## Introduction

Turbo typist is a small web browser-based game to test how fast a player can 
type. The idea of the game is to see how many words a player can type 
correctly within 99secs. 

Each successful word will count as a hit with a sound indicating the player made
a hit. A new word is provided to the player for another opportunity to hit and 
this goes on until all words from the word bank and provided to the player 
within the provided game time(99s). 

In this game, every correctly type character is removed from the word, 
and incorrectly typed characters is disabled. Similarly, backspace is disabled
too. Also important to note that that the game is not case sensitive when it 
come to typing in the words.

The game in itself has a simple user interface with minima interaction from 
the player to start the game. To play the game, the player click on the START 
button and the timer starts counting down, while the player is expected to use 
their keyboard to type in the presented words correctly.

At the end of each game, the top nine scores are displayed.
